# New-Tab-Page
Browser New Tab Page. With Firefox 57's launch, extensions are no longer allowed to serve local ///file: paths, thus breaking any new tab page with changing background images. This is a custom project to serve a node.js custom webpage when opening a new tab that will fill the function of custom new tab pages until FF lifts extension retrcitions.
